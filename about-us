		<h4>Brandon:</h4>
		<p id="brandon">
			Hi my name is Brandon. I do the coding of this webapge.
		</p>
		<h4>Liana:</h4>
		<p id="liana">
			I am the creative input for our website, a builder, and I also work on the engineering notebook/note taking. I joined in 2021 as a builder, and I worked on the robot. This year I want to learn more about building, and maybe learn about coding. The website is my first big project, and I’m very excited about it.

		<h4>Ismael:</h4>
		<p id="ismael">
			I am i can't type very well this is so bad and i am so sad too sad to be happy.

		<h4>Dane:</h4>
		<p id="dane">
			I am Dane. I am our head builder and I joined in 2021. I have loved building things for all my life. I was also the lead builder for last year's robotics challenge (freight frenzy). Probably the biggest reason I joined was to pit my hard work against others who also love to build.
		</p>
		<h4>Vibhav:</h4>
		<p id="vibhav">
			I am Vibhav. The co-team leader, and co-lead programmer. I have been doing Robotics for 2+ years now and have been programming for most of the time as well. I became interested in Robotics partly because of my parents. They are both software engineers and I was very interested in their work. The other part was that I had played around with coding for some time and I found that I enjoyed making small games and programs with it; so that’s how I became interested in robotics and programming specifically. This year, I am very excited to learn more, work harder, and do better!
		</p>
		<h4>Isaac:</h4>
		<p id="isaac">
			My name is Isaac and this is my second season of robotics in this club. I am one of our groups builders but i have been woorking in many areas of robotics this season. I have really enjoyed robotics and i want to show its greatness to anyone who wants it. My favorite color is orange, i like robotics and soccer, im in middle school and pizza is good. Goodbyeeeee.

		<h4>Linnaea:</h4>
		<p id="linnaea">
			I'm the team lead this year and am excited to start off this year with a blast. I'm part of team rocket robotics and have been part of this for about 3 years now. I enjoy managing our repo, making plans and coding. Outside of robotics I like to Hike, camp and all things outdoors. I'm a team leader and am strong at long term planning and short term emergencies. And I really
